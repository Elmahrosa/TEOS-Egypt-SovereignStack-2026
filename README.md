## 📍 Strategic Standing Statement
This repository is the **Sovereign Reference Architecture** for the TEOS ecosystem. Governance is anchored in **TEOS-FORGE**, ensuring that all technical artifacts are subservient to the **International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)**.

TEOS is **not** a speculative platform. It is a **Sovereign Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)** framework designed for institutional review, public-sector readiness, and controlled pilots under existing legal and procurement frameworks.

## 🚧 2026 Pilot Scope (Institutional Sandbox)
This repository contains the architecture for the **Cairo National ID & Data Exchange Sandbox**. This pilot is intentionally bounded to enable rigorous technical due diligence by regulators and International Financial Institutions (IFIs).

* **Target:** National Identity Registry (High-Fidelity Prototype)
* **Region:** Cairo Metropolitan Area (Simulated)
* **Population:** 5,000 Verified Digital Identities
* **Objective:** To validate end-to-end DPI functionality, including auditability, non-repudiation, and constitutional oversight.

| A toolkit for MDBs and DFIs to track impact. | An anonymous or permissionless network. |
| A "Justice-Grade" registry for state assets. | A promise of statutory replacement. |
