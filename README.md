# TEOS — Sovereign Digital Public Infrastructure  
**v1.0 Reference Architecture**

---

## 📌 Purpose

TEOS is presented as a **sovereign digital public infrastructure (DPI) reference architecture**.  
It treats Web3 not as speculation, but as **policy‑ready infrastructure** designed for governments, regulators, and development partners.

This repository is shared for **institutional review only**.  
It is **not** a procurement request, **not** a deployment commitment, and **not** a replacement for statutory systems.

## 🌍 Core Principles

- **Sovereignty** — Neutral, country‑agnostic design; no lock‑in  
- **Compliance‑first** — Audit‑ready, regulator‑aligned safeguards  
- **Policy‑ready** — Institutional framing, not startup hype  
- **SDG Alignment** — Monitoring & Evaluation logic mapped to UN Sustainable Development Goals  
- **Interoperability** — Modular architecture across multiple chains and APIs  

---

- **Identity** — Secure, sovereign digital identity modules  
- **Governance** — Transparent, auditable governance workflows  
- **Finance** — Regulated digital finance rails  
- **Infrastructure** — Assets, registries, and APIs
