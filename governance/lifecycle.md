## Contributions
- Contributions may be accepted if aligned with institutional posture:
  - compliance-first language
  - audit-ready framing

  - non-promissory, non-speculative positioning

## Standards
- Prefer institutional terms: DPI, safeguards, M&E, auditability
- Avoid: token marketing, price discussion, speculative roadmap claims
