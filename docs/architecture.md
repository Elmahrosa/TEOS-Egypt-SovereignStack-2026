# Architecture

TEOS follows a layered sovereign architecture:

1. Identity Layer (T-ID)
2. Governance Layer (T-Gov)
3. Financial Layer (T-Finance)
4. Asset & Infrastructure Layer (T-RWA, T-Infra)
5. Compliance & Audit Layer (T-Audit)
6. Institutional Integration Layer (T-API)

Each layer is modular, auditable, and deployable independently.
# Sovereign Stack Architecture

TEOS is a layered architecture:

1. **Identity Layer (T-ID)** — credentials, verification, access rights
2. **Governance Layer (T-Gov)** — proposal lifecycle, voting, decision logs
3. **Financial Layer (T-Finance)** — regulated records, settlement logs, reporting
4. **Asset & Infrastructure Layer (T-RWA, T-Infra)** — registries, program assets, logistics
5. **Compliance Layer (T-Audit)** — audit trails, oversight access, controls evidence
6. **Integration Layer (T-API, T-Bridge)** — institutional APIs, interoperability

Each layer is modular, auditable, and integrable with existing systems.
